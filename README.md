## My process

I have used Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind CSS provided a robust set of utility classes that allowed me to quickly and efficiently style the components and layout of my project.

### Built with

- HTML 5
- TailWind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing Tailwind CSS utility classes effectively. I discovered the power of extending styles using directives such as `@apply` to create custom designs that are not explicitly listed in Tailwind's utility classes. This project also reinforced the importance of adopting a mobile-first workflow, ensuring that the design and functionality are optimized for smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices.


### Continued development

I plan to continue using Tailwind CSS in future projects. Its utility-first approach and extensive set of pre-built styles have significantly streamlined my development process and allowed me to create responsive and visually appealing designs efficiently. I look forward to exploring more advanced features and optimizations offered by Tailwind CSS to enhance my skills further.
